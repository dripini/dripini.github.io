# Welcome to my Profile.

I am a passionate front-end and back-end developer from Ireland üáÆüá™ ‚òòÔ∏è

I use JavaScript and Python most of the time for backend programming (JavaScript for front-end).

## How I learnt
![Hi](javascript2.svg) 

I learnt JS(JavaScript) using [CodeCademy](https://codecademy.com), [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/) and [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). Although CodeCademy and Scrimba helped me the most, Free Code Camp is still very good. You can also learn üêç Python with those too! I code on a ASUS Chromebook C223N but I really want an Acer NITRO 5 256GB (¬£630) and a MEDION Crawler E10 512GB (¬£543) but I cant get either of them because of expenses. But otheer than that, you should check out Scrimba, CodeCademy and freeCodeCamp

### Scrimba
Scrimba allows you to study where you want, when you want. We also substitute the classroom teaching experience with interactive screencast, live events, and peer-to-peer help between students.


### CodeCademy
If you're just getting started learning to code, Codecademy is a great way to get a sense for what coding is and how it works. It's also a great free way to see if coding might be something that speaks to you as a potential career option before jumping in with both feet.


### freeCodeCamp
It compiles the often scattered information about coding into clear and useful lessons. If you are a self-learner, freeCodeCamp is a great place to start learning. If you're just looking for a good free primer in web development before a bootcamp, freeCodeCamp might be a good option.

## What should you choose?
#### I think Scrimba is the way forward if you have just started coding! It has:
- A friendly community that learns to code **with** you in **Discord**
- Multiple Courses including;
- React
- JavaScript
- UI Design
- From Figma to Code
- To unit testing
- It includes a front end career path.

  **And It is Interactive!**

## Why i open-source 
Open Source is great if you want to do things quicker because of **contributions**!
Open source has been very helpful to many startups due to how you can easily edit the source code and modify to suit your needs.
The philosophy of open-source is that everyone can contribute to make a better project.
